

	When you are using display inline-block, the elements are on the same line with one another.

	Vertical align pushes the element to the top of the the containing container.

	Use '#' for id which is for one particular thing; while the  '.' is for class which can be used for many items.

	No space should be in between elements, otherwise, they will not be on the same line
